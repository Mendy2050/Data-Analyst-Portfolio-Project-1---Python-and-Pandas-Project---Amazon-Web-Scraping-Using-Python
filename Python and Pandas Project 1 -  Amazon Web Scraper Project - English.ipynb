    "This code utilizes Python's smtplib module to send a simple email.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, establish a session by connecting to the SMTP server (Gmail server) using an insecure SMTP connection:\n",
    "server = smtplib.SMTP_SSL('smtp.gmail.com', 465)\n",
    "server.ehlo()\n",
    "\n",
    "- `smtplib` is a built-in Python module for implementing the SMTP protocol client for sending emails.\n",
    "\t- `SMTP_SSL('smtp.gmail.com', 465)` specifies the usage of an SSL-encrypted connection.\n",
    "\t- `'smtp.gmail.com'` is the address of the Gmail SMTP server.\n",
    "\t- `465` is the default SSL port for the Gmail SMTP server.\n",
    "- `server = smtplib.SMTP_SSL(...)` creates an SMTP object to manage the connection session with the server.\n",
    "- `server.ehlo()` sends an EHLO command to the server, initiating the server's self-introduction. This is a step in the SMTP session protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "- Create an SMTP object using `smtplib`.\n",
    "- Specify the encryption protocol and server address port.\n",
    "- Send an EHLO command to establish a handshake with the server.\n",
    "- These steps establish a secure connection session between the Python program and the Gmail SMTP server.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then, upgrade to a secure connection using `starttls()`:\n",
    "server.starttls()\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `server.starttls()` method is used to initiate a TLS (Transport Layer Security) secure connection on the previously established insecure SMTP session.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose and meaning:\n",
    "- The SMTP protocol defaults to plain text transmission, which can be intercepted by intermediaries.\n",
    "- By using `starttls()`, the connection is upgraded to a secure (encrypted) connection, preventing eavesdropping.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the purpose of `starttls()` is:\n",
    "- To initiate the TLS protocol on the initially established plain text SMTP session.\n",
    "- To upgrade the connection from plain text to an encrypted secure SMTP connection.\n",
    "- To protect the security of subsequent transmitted information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, if the SMTP service is enabled with SSL, there is no need to use `starttls()`.\n",
    "Using `starttls()` provides a secure upgrade method for some third-party SMTP services that do not support SSL.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. After a successful upgrade, proceed with further interactions such as logging in and sending emails: Log in to the email account and obtain SMTP authorization.\n",
    "server.login('AlexTheAnalyst95@gmail.com', 'password')\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Define the email content and subject:\n",
    "subject = \"Subject title\"\n",
    "body = \"Email body content\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Construct the complete email content:\n",
    "msg = f\"Subject: {subject}\\n\\n{body}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Send the email:\n",
    "server.sendmail(\n",
    "    'from@email.com',\n",
    "    'to@email.com',\n",
    "    msg\n",
